# Project Topic : CTFWeb
This web was a product of a past assignment in Web Programming Course.

# System Description
Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and mixed. This site focused on Jeopardy-style CTFs.

The Jeopardy-style CTF is similar to the actual Jeopardy game as the scoreboard looks like a Jeopardy board with different categories and point values. Some of the categories can include Cryptography, Steganography, Physical Security and Scanning. There are several other categories that can be used. Some of the challenges can be done against a main server that was developed for the CTF and the flag is inputted into the CTF scoreboard to get points for the team. A timer is used to start and stop the CTF and once the timer finishes, the game is over. The team with the most points at the end wins.

This site focuses on individual solving Jeopardies, and sharing their own problem to the others. Each user can post their own problems publicly, and they have access to all problem posted.
