## Sketches

## Design Rationale
Given all of the breakdowns that we encounter we decided to fix them one by one since experienced user still found breakdowns in our legacy design. It includes separating the page into multiple page, grouped some menu with their correct group, remove cryptic errors, and add feedback (hint) to user to reduce the time it takes for them to figure out something.
